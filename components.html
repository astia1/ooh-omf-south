    Included in the 2016 voter-approved Sound Transit 3 measure, the Stride
    program will provide fast, frequent, and reliable transit service to people
    living and working along I-405 and SR 522. New Stride connections from
    Bellevue to Burien, Lynnwood to Bellevue, and Shoreline and Seattle to
    Bothell build upon Sound Transit’s commitment to equitable, accessible, and
    affordable transportation. With projected population growth across the Puget
    Sound, Stride is a 19-hour-a-day service that will meet more people’s
    transportation needs and connect the region in new and faster ways. There is
    no need to look at a bus schedule for Stride, since buses come every 10 to
    15 minutes. It offers an easy alternative to driving congested roadways,
    bypassing traffic on I-405 in the Express toll lanes and building Business
    Access and Transit lanes on SR 522. Stride lines will work with regional
    partners to provide more service in addition to integrating with Sound
    Transit Link service. Stride's connections to light rail can take you to a
    Mariners game or the Sea-Tac Airport and eventually all the way to Everett
    or Tacoma. S3 stops along the Burke-Gilman Trail, so you can enjoy a scenic
    walk or bike ride to Stride stations.
